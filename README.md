Data acquisition software collection for Pratham satellite ground station at IPGP
==============

A set of tools developed at the [Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris](http://www.ipgp.fr) that helps [Pratham satellite](http://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/pratham/) ground station developers automate control, data acquisition (SCADA) and demodulation tasks under [LabVIEW](http://www.ni.com/labview/).

Further documentation on technical and scientific issues can be found in [ipgp-pratham-doc](https://github.com/EmptyStackExn/ipgp-pratham-doc) repository. _*NIX_ users can find ports of LabVIEW for [FreeBSD](http://people.freebsd.org/~murray/daq.html#labview) and [Linux](http://www.ni.com/white-paper/11786/en) operating systems.

Usage of `ipgp-pratham-daq-collection` is allowed under the terms listed in LICENSE section at the bottom of this file.

Downloading and building
=============

To download you can click upon (`ZIP` button) or type the following line in the Terminal:

	git clone git://github.com/EmptyStackExn/ipgp-pratham-daq-collection.git

The directory `./ipgp-pratham-daq-collection/` is created within you can find:

- `Main.vi` : main data acquisition automation tool
- `Digitization_of_signal.vi` : signal digitizer
- `FSK_demodulation_of_signal.vi` : FSK demodulator
- `Pratham_type_signal_generator.vi` : Pratham-type signal generator
- `Pratham_type_rawfile_generator.vi` : Pratham-type raw signal generator
- `Wave_file_of_LVM_file.vi` : returns a [WAVE audio](http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/WAVE/WAVE.html) file of a signal
- `LVM_file_of_wave_file.vi` : inversed map of the previous program

Open and execute them with LabVIEW.
